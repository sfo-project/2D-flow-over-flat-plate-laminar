    "# CFD Simulation Case Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**The created CFD domain is now read into the CFD package of interest to setup the CFD simulation. It should be noted that the current tutorial has a significant difference compared to other available CFD tutorials online! This tutorial is structured and developed based on a generic and methodological approach to set up a CFD simulation. The first principals and reasonings for each setting is discussed at each step. Potential alterations and modifications to perform similar analysis for different flow conditions are also addressed and discussed. Hence, in the end user will have the capability of applying potential modifications, improvements or extending the application of the current CFD simulation to a more complex problem of interest, rather than having a one time successful run of a specific simulation with specific and strictly pre-defined boundary conditions.**\n",

    "> **_In simple words: Current tutorial teaches users to fish, rather than giving them a fish._**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up a CFD simulation has following four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the physics of the flow field user will select required model/s to simulate the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "User will define the physical and thermodynamical properties of the working fluid/s and solid/s in the problem.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary & Zone Conditions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the governing equations of the flow (i.e. system of partial differential equations) requires well-defined boundary conditions within the CFD domain. These conditions are selected and defined in this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Setup Solution Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In CFD simulations the governing equations of the flow are solve numerically. Based on the physics of the problem appropriate numerical schemes and solution methods are selected at this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section the details for the above-mentioned four steps of the CFD simulation setup process for the case study of **2D Laminar Flow Over a Flat plate** are explained in great details. As a general guideline, to setup a CFD simulation in OpenFoam it is recommended to start with files from one of the provided default tutorials in OpenFoam located in `OpenFoam/run/tutorials`. Users should find appropriate tutorial such that the general physics of the chosen tutorial is close to the problem of interest of users. This way, the majority of the required physical settings are pre-set and the others can be changed/modified accordingly. For example for the problem of **2D Laminar Flow Over a Flat plate** the tutorial of **2D over an airfoil** located at `OpenFoam/run/tutorials/incompressible/simpleFoam/airFoil2D` is used. Using the previously developed file, the above-mentioned four steps for CFD simulation development is done via editing the corresponding files, where the settings are defined and are located in the main working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main assumption in the classical problem of a two dimensional flow over a flat plate is that the free stream flow is uniform and steady. Therefore, the steady model is chosen to develop this CFD simulation. This along with other numerical schemes settings are set in a dictionary file called \"fvSchemes\" located at `\\system` folder. To set the solver to be steady users define `steadyState` for the `ddtSchemes` and the rest of the settings will remain unchanged:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "ddtSchemes\n",
    "{\n",
    "    default         steadyState;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In cases where the flow properties rapidly changes with respect to time the Transient model should be chosen in this step. Various available time schemes along with other implementable option within \"fvSchemes\" dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/fvschemes/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current problem the focus is to investigate laminar flow and boundary layer behavior when a uniform flow passes over a flat plate. The appropriate model for this problem is set in a dictionary file called `RASPropertise` (RAS stands for Reynolds Averages Stress) located at `\\constant` folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "RASModel        laminar;\n",
    "\n",
    "turbulence      off;\n",
    "\n",
    "printCoeffs     off;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the critical Reynolds number for flows over flat plate is about 1.24E+6. In cases that the Reynolds number, based on flat plate length (as the length scale), is greater than this critical value the model the appropriate turbulent model should be selected at this step. Various available turbulence models along with other options within `RASPropertise` dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/turbulence/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of working fluid is problem dependent. In the absence of obligations to define a specific working fluid such as air or water, it is suggested that the users define the working fluid such that the important non-dimensional groups of interest, such as Reynolds number in this problem, is matched the desired flow conditions. This strategy removes the uncertainty in the choice of the working fluid and will solidify the bases for expected physical observations. The material properties in OpenFoam can be defined in a dictionary file `transportPropertise` located in `constant` folder. In this file the material is set to be `Newtonian` fluid with a defined kinematic viscosity **\\nu**. It should be noted that the numbers in the [] set the dimension of the flow field variable of interest and the other number sets it's value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "transportModel  Newtonian;\n",
    "\n",
    "nu              nu [ 0 2 -1 0 0 0 0 ] 0.01;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Considering that the flat plate length in 1 [m] and user will define a unit constant uniform velocity (1 [m/s]), the value of **\\nu** will be defined as the inverse of Reynolds number. Therefore, changing this value would set the nominal Reynolds number of the flow based on the flat plate length. For other cases users should define the working fluid via this process. Various available transport models along with other options within `transportPropertise` dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/transport-rheology/#x40-2210007.3.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary and Zone Conditions:**   \n",
    "In OpenFoam the type of boundaries within the CFD domain are defined in the `boundary` file located at `\\constant\\polyMesh`. Whether the users use blockMesh or the convert command to create the CFD domain and discretize the `boundary` file will be created in this process. Furthermore values for the field variables, such as velocity **U** and pressure **p**, at these boundaries are set in `U` and `p` files located at `0` folder located in the working directory respectively. The `0` folder includes the values of the field variables at boundaries for the time `t=0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier in the CFD domain's creation and discretization section, the CFD domain has four faces as boundaries. The boundary and zone conditions settings to develop CFD simulation for **2D Laminar Flow Over a Flat plate** case in OpenFoam are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inlet:** The flow enters from the inlet face of the CFD domain with constant velocity and uniform atmospheric pressure (i.e. zero gauge pressure). To set the type of this boundary edit `boundary` file in `\\constant\\polyMesh`. Set the type of face to `patch`, which is a condition that contains no geometric or\n",
